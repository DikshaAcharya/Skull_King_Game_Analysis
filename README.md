--> Interactive analysis helps in understanding the dynamics and the complexity of the game. 
--> give the time for this project couly only focus on one game and limited to basic representation of statistic analysis....
-->  a bigger dataset will be able to provide better information on which strategies work the best and which don't.
--> Can create a risk index
--> could also improve the interactivity by adding the YoHoHo sound effect when a round is clicked --> improve user experience.
